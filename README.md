# Matthew Zengoski's Portfolio Page

This repository houses all my projects to be shown to others.

[Access the website here](https://matthewzengoski.me)

## Accessing code

All code can be found inside the */web-projects* folder unless it is redirected to its own site.  

The following projects are maintained in their own repositories due to being external sites:

 - [FE Engage Growths Calculator](https://github.com/Diminious/engage-growths)
 - [Reddit Viewer](https://github.com/Diminious/reddit-client)
