        <section class="game-jam">
            <p>Every two weeks, our club hosts the University Gaming Club Jam (UGC Jam), where anyone, regardless of skill or previous acknowledgements, can make a game over a single weekend. It's entirely free to join, whether you are a member or not. Our goal is to bring together anyone and everyone in order to make a memorable event.</p>
            <p>The UGC Jam is a 72-hour jam where both solo and group developers can work to submit a game based on the theme and limitations given to them.</p>
